# Undercroft Roadmap

Undercroft is the Rust conversion of MemPalace with a hardened memory-management
layer (isolated vaults, XChaCha20-Poly1305 encryption, HMAC integrity).

## v0.2.0 — Feature parity + Python removal (done)

- Legacy Python implementation and tooling fully removed
- Knowledge graph: temporal facts with validity windows (add / query /
  invalidate / supersede / timeline / stats), objects sealed in encrypted
  vaults, triples HMAC-tagged and audit-chained
- Conversation mining (`mine --mode convos`) for Claude Code / Codex JSONL
  transcripts + idempotent per-message `sweep`
- Drawer management (get / list / update / delete / delete-by-source /
  check-dup with keyed fingerprints), dedup, stats, taxonomy
- Agent diaries (per-agent wings), cross-wing tunnels (create / follow /
  traverse), computed hallways (entity co-occurrence)
- Verified backups (create / list / restore, keeps last 10), repair
- Auto-save hook settings output for Claude Code
- MCP server: 30 tools across palace core, drawers, navigation, KG,
  diaries, maintenance

## v0.1.0 — Core port + vault layer (done)

- Rust workspace; palace domain model; deterministic drawer ids; chunking
- Vault layer: per-vault HKDF key derivation, AEAD sealing, HMAC record
  tags, tamper-evident audit chain, MAC'd manifests, sealed / hmac-only
- SQLite per-vault storage; hybrid search; CLI; Docker-first test harness

## Next

- **v0.3 — Retrieval quality**: model-based embedder behind the `Embedder`
  trait (ONNX / candle) with identity tracking; FTS5 BM25 pre-filter for
  hmac-only vaults; LongMemEval / LoCoMo harness to measure the port honestly
- **v0.4 — Ecosystem**: server backends (pgvector, qdrant) with client-side
  sealing so bytes leave the process encrypted; key rotation; export bundles
  with recipient encryption; L2 on-demand room loading heuristics
