# Undercroft — agent guide

Undercroft is a Rust conversion of MemPalace: hardened, local-first AI memory.
Verbatim drawers filed into wings/rooms, stored in isolated **vaults** with
per-vault HKDF-derived keys, XChaCha20-Poly1305 content sealing, and
HMAC-SHA256 integrity tags + a tamper-evident audit chain.

## Layout

- `Cargo.toml` — workspace root (11 crates; `undercroft-embed-onnx` and
  `undercroft-embed-ort` excluded from default-members — heavy ML deps,
  built explicitly)
- `crates/undercroft-core` — domain model, chunking, ids, normalization
  (`normalize.rs`: `NormalizeMode::{Prose,Code}` + `mode_for_path` — code
  and fenced blocks keep indentation/trailing space/blank runs; both modes
  keep the safety floor; `match_key` = NFC **comparison keys only**, never
  applied to stored bytes — the promise is verbatim and NORMALIZE_VERSION is
  inside the drawer id, so folding on the write path would move every future
  id; used by `fingerprint()` — i.e. **dedup**, which is why folding cannot go
  here: `中國` and `中国` must not become one drawer. **No tokenizer uses it
  any more**; they use `search_key`), the retrieval fold (`search_key` — NFC,
  scoped compatibility expansion, recompose, lowercase, mark strip, letter
  map, in that order: lowercase must precede the strip because `İ` is not a
  mark and lowercasing is what *manufactures* the U+0307 the strip removes,
  which is how `İZMİR` stops tokenizing to `zmi` without any Turkic
  tailoring. Not blanket NFKC — the alphanumeric-to-alphanumeric guard is what
  rejects `ﷺ` (So, 18 chars) and `﷼` (Sc, a delimiter that would become
  letters); CJK radicals invert that guard since they are themselves So.
  Cyrillic gets only a **loose** stress mark plus `ё→е`, because a blanket
  decompose-and-strip would turn `й` into `и`; ZWSP/ZWNJ/ZWJ are pinned as
  **not** stripped — ZWSP is Khmer's word delimiter and ZWJ is contrastive in
  Malayalam. Every fold's conflation is pinned by test: على/علي, كتابة/كتابه,
  Masse/Maße, πότε/ποτέ, все/всё),
  script-aware segmentation (`script.rs`: `Script` — Hebrew is
  `attaches_without_delimiter`, NOT `Other`: it writes with spaces but its
  clitics (`ה`/`ב`/`ל`/`ו`/`מ`/`ש`) attach with none, exactly as Arabic's do,
  and classed as delimiting it got an 8-character floor for 3-character stems
  while being excluded from `shares_a_stem` — measured, the only language in a
  15-language audit to admit **nothing at all**. A two-character subrun is a
  WORD, not a fragment, so `emit` flags n-grams only above length two: `גן`,
  `בן`, `יד` were exact matches before the reclassification and became
  unreachable after it. +
  `segment` — splitting on `!is_alphanumeric` finds no boundary in Han, Kana,
  Hangul, Bopomofo, Arabic, Khmer, Thai, Lao or Myanmar, so a clause became
  one token and a query for a word the drawer contains returned **nothing at
  all** — `search` drops a hit with no lexical evidence and a neutral cosine,
  so the observable was an empty result, not a bad ranking. Bigrams over
  maximal same-**script** subruns, plus unigrams only where a character is a
  word (`is_logographic` — Han only; unigrams in an alphabetic script make
  `قطار` match `المستشفى` on a shared alef and retire the relevance gate).
  A joining mark (combining class 7 or 9 — virama, nukta) is word-INTERNAL and
  continues a run, but **only in a delimiting script**: `नमस्ते` was `नमस`+`ते`,
  and the fragments matched unrelated words (`दिल` inside `दिल्ली`). Blanket-
  joining is wrong — in a non-delimiting script `emit` makes bigrams and a
  consonant+mark bigram is not injective, so Thai `เก่า`/`ก่อน` would share `ก่`.
  `Segmented.ngram` marks which tokens are n-grams from a non-delimiting,
  **non-logographic** script; the store refuses them the EXACT slot, because a
  shared two-character substring in an unvocalised abjad is not evidence —
  measured, bigram-to-bigram equality admitted **74.3%** of a real Arabic
  corpus on one query, against 6.9% for Greek. Whole-word containment
  (`shares_a_stem`, ≥3 chars) carries the clitics instead, into `lexical_morph`.
  Han is not flagged: there a character is a morpheme.
  Latin/digit subruns stay whole so a brand name inside CJK survives;
  delimiting scripts — Latin, Cyrillic, Greek, Georgian, Tibetan — are
  untouched, their defects being folding and morphology, which n-grams do not
  address. `segment` filters nothing — BM25 applies the historical `len() > 1`
  **byte** test, the embedder does not, because a one-letter word is signal
  there), hashed n-gram embedder identity (`embed.rs`: `HASH_EMBEDDER` =
  `undercroft-hash-v3` — v1 neither folded nor segmented, v2 shattered Brahmic
  conjuncts; the store migrates
  **every known predecessor** to v3 automatically at open via
  `KNOWN_EMBEDDER_UPGRADES` (both v1→v3 and v2→v3 — v2 shipped in no tag but
  existed on the branch, and without its row such a vault matches on name,
  returns early, and keeps vectors from a different token space silently), since a user
  who merely upgraded the binary did not choose a new vector space. Embeddings
  are not HMAC-covered, so a re-embed never touches a drawer tag or the audit
  chain — which is why this is not a rotation. The walk is batched, idempotent,
  and records the new identity **last**, so a crash mid-walk just repeats it;
  it also drops the PQ/IVF tables, whose codebook quantizes vectors that no
  longer exist. Unreadable rows are **skipped, not fatal** — a walk inside
  `open` that aborts leaves the vault unopenable for `verify` and `repair`
  too, which is worse than a stale vector on a row that already fails every
  read. `UNDERCROFT_FORCE_EMBEDDER=1` is checked **before** the migration
  branch or it would be dead code for the one transition that can fail, and
  `open_read_only` (used by `serve --read-only`) warns instead of writing.
  A swap to or from a *model* embedder stays manual —
  `UNDERCROFT_FORCE_EMBEDDER=1` + `repair`), grounding (`support.rs`:
  `Support`/`Span`/`Grounding` —
  spans as offsets, never copied text), temporal extraction (`temporal.rs`: in-text
  absolute + relative dates, resolved against the drawer's `content_date`,
  never guessed; a mention resolves to a **period** (`resolved` +
  `resolved_end`, `range()`) so "May 2023" and "last week" stay the month and
  the week instead of collapsing onto a first day; exact calendar
  arithmetic — `days_between`,
  `calendar_weeks_between` (boundaries crossed, not days/7),
  `calendar_months_between`, `hours_between` on absolute instants,
  `describe_interval` (years counted on the calendar, never days/365),
  `WeekStart::{Monday,Sunday,Saturday}` since first-day-of-week is locale
  data and it moves "last week"/"this Thursday" as well as the counts
  (`*_with` variants throughout); `Locale{language,week_start,date_order,
  calendar}` — FOUR read-time declarations, none of them inferred, because
  script is not evidence (Thai script writes Gregorian constantly) and a
  numeral system is not a calendar (`๒๐๒๖` is an ordinary Gregorian 2026 in
  Thai digits and reading the glyphs as an era claim resolved it to **1483**).
  `Calendar::{Gregorian,Buddhist,Minguo,Hijri,Jalali}` — the first three are a
  renumbered year and convert by arithmetic; Hijri (**Umm al-Qura**, the Saudi
  civil calendar, NOT the tabular variant that is easy to write and wrong by a
  day or two) and Jalali are different calendars, so conversion is whole-date
  via `calendrical_calculations` (Apache-2.0, 3 transitive deps, pure algorithm,
  no data files, Unicode Consortium/ICU4X — attributed in NOTICE).
  `DateOrder` takes four signals strongest-first: declared; **demonstrated by
  the text** (`13/05` can only be day-first, so an unambiguous date states the
  writer's convention by example — EVIDENCE, not inference); implied by the
  language (CLDR gives `ar` as d/M/y in every Arabic territory, English splits
  US/Commonwealth and implies nothing, which is why `Locale::ARABIC` declares an
  order and `Locale::ENGLISH` does not); then day-first. There is no
  `GREGORIAN_MAX` any more — it bounded years at 2199 to stop Buddhist 2566
  reading as Gregorian 2566, and once a calendar could be declared it began
  discarding legitimate far-future dates (a novel, an astronomy note) to guard
  against an ambiguity a declaration settles; `Locale{language,week_start}` +
  `Language::{English,Arabic}` selects a **scanner, not a table** —
  Arabic puts the past marker before the count (قبل ثلاثة أيام), has a
  dual (يومين = two days as one word), puts period modifiers after the
  noun (الأسبوع الماضي), reads both Gregorian month-name systems
  (Levantine كانون الثاني + Roman يناير) and Arabic-Indic digits;
  the locale is a **read-time** parameter (`live_time_mentions_in`,
  `language` on `/v1/search` and `undercroft_search`) because the reading
  is live, so a corpus ingested under one locale answers correctly under
  another with no re-ingest;
  every shift is checked — hostile counts resolve to nothing, never a panic
  and never the unshifted anchor; local dates come from the offset the
  timestamp itself carries, never from
  the host clock, so a vault answers identically on every machine), hashed
  n-gram embedder (`embed.rs`: `Embedder` trait + `HashEmbedder`), reranker
  trait (`rerank.rs`: `Reranker`), late-interaction trait + MaxSim + int8
  token packing (`late.rs`: `LateInteraction`), conversation parsing, entities
- `crates/undercroft-vault` — security layer (keys.rs: master key + HKDF;
  seal.rs: AEAD + HMAC; lib.rs: VaultManager/Vault + manifest-as-rollback-
  anchor + pure chain arithmetic + key rotation primitives
  (rotation_candidate, byte-exact reseal_at_rest, two-phase
  vault.json.next staging, keycheck marker); bundle.rs:
  recipient-encrypted export bundles (X25519 ephemeral-static → HKDF →
  XChaCha20-Poly1305); at-rest AAD domains: content, `/emb`, `/tok`
  token matrices, `/pq` index artifacts)
- `crates/undercroft-store` — per-vault SQLite storage, hybrid search (cosine +
  BM25 fusion; `SearchHit` carries **three** lexical channels — `lexical_exact`
  (the drawer said the word) and `lexical_morph` (it holds a word built on it —
  today only `contains_a_long_word`) both **admit** via `hits.retain`, kept
  apart so a caller can tell the two claims from each other; `lexical` ranks and
  discounts both morph and approximate evidence at half weight, capped at one
  per query slot. On `Fusion::Legacy` and the remote path `lexical_morph` is 0
  because `lexical_score`'s exact leg is unrestricted substring containment and
  already counts that relation as exact — a shipped asymmetry, now narrowed. A fold makes two words
  one token and `fuzzy_eq`/`same_word_family` forgive difference, so on one
  channel each of those would be a *membership* decision; `same_word_family`
  is the reachable half of morphology — nearly-a-prefix, ≥7 shared chars,
  tail ≤3, which excludes the `-tive`/`-tion` class at exactly 6 and cannot
  reach Russian case or Arabic broken plurals at all. `drawers_fts` is a
  **standalone** fts5 table over `search_key(content)`, rebuilt on a
  `fts_key_version` mismatch: external-content over raw bytes disagreed with
  folded query terms, and the prefilter is only safe when it finds *nothing*)
  + optional cross-encoder rerank + ColBERT late-interaction
  stage (latestage.rs: token store, event-driven token-PQ codebook, LUT
  MaxSim), PQ/IVF candidate prefilter for both vault levels (pq.rs primitive,
  pqidx.rs index; both levels scan a load-once RAM code cache, slab-grouped
  by IVF list since v0.41.0; opt-in sealed page tier since v0.42.0 —
  `UNDERCROFT_PQ_PAGE_MIN`, one AEAD page per list + lazy per-probe
  decrypt + tail fold per batch, default off), MUVERA FDE
  token-aware candidates (fdeidx.rs; core fde.rs construction; sealed
  `drawer_fde` + `fde_meta`; opt-in inverted tier via
  `UNDERCROFT_FDE_IVF_MIN` — slab-grouped cache + sealed centroids, kept
  default-off by its measured containment gate), experimental in-memory
  HNSW (hnsw.rs, `hnsw` feature), transactional audit chain (`chain_meta` + `chain_append`),
  verify, knowledge graph (kg.rs), management surface (manage.rs),
  remote-index integration (remote.rs — a mirror records the embedder it was
  pushed with; `search_with_index` refuses a mismatch rather than ranking a
  v2 query against v1 vectors, which returned an empty result with no error),
  in-place key rotation
  (rotate.rs: one-transaction re-seal of every artifact + chain re-key
  over preserved audit bytes, crash-reconciled at open), bulk ingest
  (`upsert_many`: one transaction + one manifest anchor per batch —
  advisory encode paths must never BEGIN or batching breaks)
- `crates/undercroft-obs` — observability shim: no-op + **zero deps** by default;
  under `--features telemetry` brings up `tracing` logs, Prometheus `/metrics`,
  OTLP traces (metadata-only spans), and the live SSE broker
- `crates/undercroft-index` — remote vector backends (Qdrant/Chroma/pgvector/
  Milvus/Weaviate) as untrusted accelerators; sealed content only, re-verified
- `crates/undercroft-llm` — local LLM runtimes (Ollama/OpenAI-compatible) for
  `refine` → KG extraction; no external API by default
- `crates/undercroft-embed-onnx` — feature-gated ONNX embedder, cross-encoder
  reranker, **and** ColBERT late-interaction encoder (tract, pure Rust; two
  fixed-shape plans per ColBERT export — dynamic-axis exports carry ops tract
  rejects); built via the `onnx-build` compose service. Models are
  user-supplied; tract 0.22 runs BERT-family models, **not** DeBERTa rerankers
- `crates/undercroft-embed-ort` — opt-in ONNX Runtime backend (C++ dep;
  `ort-build` compose service): session-pool embedder + reranker + ColBERT
  encoder (late.rs — same exports/env as the tract one), ~2.5× tract per
  forward, int8 model support; pinned `ort = 2.0.0-rc.10`. Wired into the
  CLI via `--features ort` (`UNDERCROFT_EMBEDDER=ort`,
  `UNDERCROFT_RERANKER=ort|colbert-ort`; multi-tenant server shares one
  session pool across vaults)
- `crates/undercroft-cli` — `undercroft` binary (main.rs: CLI; mcp.rs: MCP stdio;
  http.rs/tenant.rs: HTTP + multi-tenant `/v1` incl. management routes
  (drawers list/get/update, taxonomy, verify, rotate, read-only kg
  browse); ui.html: the vault admin console (incl. live MONITOR +
  KNOWLEDGE tabs), `include_str!`'d and served at `GET /ui` on every
  build; monitor.html: the Palace Monitor
  UI, `include_str!`'d and served at `GET /monitor` on telemetry builds);
  integration tests in `tests/cli.rs`
- `crates/undercroft-orchestrator` — `undercroft-orchestrator` binary: the
  optional multi-tenant control plane (docs/MULTI_TENANCY.md) — instance
  registry + tenant→vault map in its own SQLite (engine creds sealed,
  tokens stored as HMACs), `/t/*` routing proxy, `/admin/*` plane,
  count-verified migration, fleet console (ui.html at `GET /ui`),
  read replicas (`serve --read-replica`: RO state db, data plane only,
  `/healthz` mode+last_write lag surface).
  Pure `/v1` client; never linked by the engine
- `crates/undercroft-bench` — LongMemEval/LoCoMo/ConvoMem/MemBench/model-eval
  harnesses (`--features onnx` for model rows; `--skip`/`--limit` sharding)
- `deploy/observability/` — Prometheus + Alertmanager + Loki + Tempo + Grafana
  stack (see its README.md + RUNBOOK.md)
- `architecture/` — illustrated architecture reference: four theme-aware
  SVG diagrams (`diagrams/`), the same as PDF (`pdf/`, rebuilt by
  `build.sh` — librsvg has no CSS-variable support, so the build
  flattens each `var()` to its light fallback first), and `index.html`
  which inlines them and documents every layer plus all 60
  `UNDERCROFT_*` variables
- `website/` — GitHub Pages: `landing/index.html` (custom landing) + mdBook docs
  under `src/`
- `tests/e2e.sh`, `tests/e2e-backends.sh`, `tests/e2e-telemetry.sh`,
  `tests/e2e-orchestrator.sh` — end-to-end suites (run in Docker)
- `docs/AGENTS.md` — the scenario-driven agent implementation guide
  (published as docs/agents.html); its tool/route/env reference must be
  kept in sync when the MCP surface, `/v1` routes, or `UNDERCROFT_*`
  variables change
- `SECURITY.md` (disclosure policy; private vulnerability reporting is
  enabled on the repo), `NOTICE` (MemPalace MIT heritage attribution),
  `LICENSE` (BUSL 1.1 — see Conventions)
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` — on every `v*` tag: five binary
  targets (linux x86_64/arm64 native, macOS Intel cross-compiled on
  macos-latest + Apple Silicon, windows) uploaded to the release with
  sha256, and the multi-arch `ghcr.io/compufreq/undercroft` image
  (per-arch native builds merged into one manifest; index annotations
  carry the package description)

The upstream Python implementation (the MemPalace project) is *not* in
this repo and no longer linked as a fork; its behavior is documented in
docs/PARITY.md. Never reintroduce Python code here.

## Build & test — Docker only

Build and test **inside containers**, not on the host (project policy):

```bash
docker compose run --rm test          # cargo unit + integration tests (249)
docker compose run --rm lint          # rustfmt --check + clippy -D warnings
docker compose run --rm e2e           # e2e UI/UX suite against the release binary (157 checks)
docker compose run --rm orchestrator-e2e  # two engines + orchestrator (44 checks)
docker compose run --rm e2e-telemetry # telemetry build + /metrics gating (16 checks)
docker compose run --rm backends-e2e  # five live vector DBs (47 checks; weaviate
                                      # readiness gates on /v1/schema==200 — it
                                      # answers HTTP before its Raft leader exists)
docker compose run --rm onnx-build    # compile-check the ONNX embedder+reranker feature
docker compose run --rm ort-build    # compile-check CLI with --features onnx,ort
                                      # (CI clippy never sees non-default features —
                                      # clippy ort-gated code here explicitly)
docker compose run --rm site          # build the mdBook docs (mdbook pinned 0.5.4;
                                      # mermaid via vendored website/assets/mermaid.min.js)
docker build -t undercroft .           # runtime image
```

**Always pass `--build`.** The battery images COPY the source, they do not
mount it — `docker compose run --rm test` without `--build` silently
re-runs whatever was baked into the last image, so a "green" run can be
testing code you already changed. rustfmt cannot fix host files from those
images either; mount the repo instead:
`docker run --rm -v "<repo>:/src" -w /src rust:1.90-slim-bookworm sh -c "rustup component add rustfmt; cargo fmt --all"`

CI runs `cargo fmt --all --check` + `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`
(no `--workspace`, so the excluded onnx crate is fmt'd but not clippy'd in CI).
Heavy cargo work: use the `undercroft-target` volume + `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/build`
(host bind-mounted `target/` SIGBUSes under memory pressure).

## Invariants to preserve (inherited from MemPalace's mission + vault layer)

- Content is stored **verbatim** — never summarize, paraphrase, or lossy-
  compress user data on the write path. Retrieval returns the exact words.
- Local-first, zero external API by default: no phone-home; the default
  embedder is deterministic and offline. Observability is **opt-in** behind
  `--features telemetry` — default builds carry zero telemetry deps and emit
  nothing; when on, signals are **metadata/counts only** (never drawer content
  or keys) and nothing leaves the process unless an endpoint is set.
- Derived structure that is recomputable from content must **not** be
  persisted in clear beside it, and where it is recomputable at read it
  generally should not be persisted at all — `time_mentions` and `entities`
  are both read live (`live_time_mentions_in`, `live_entities`), which is
  also what makes a scanner fix and a language choice reach existing vaults
  with no migration.
- Drawer ids are deterministic over (wing, room, source, chunk_index,
  normalize_version); re-mining must stay idempotent and append-only — a crash
  mid-operation must leave the existing palace untouched. On the API save
  paths there is no source, so `chunk_index` carries a **unique append
  index** (`next_append_index`, backed by SQLite's AUTOINCREMENT sequence)
  rather than a position within a document: those saves are unique-per-call,
  not idempotent, and collapsing repeats is dedup's job. Never index an
  append with `count()` — it decreases on delete, and a reused index derives
  an id that already exists, silently overwriting an unrelated drawer.
- Sealed vaults must never persist plaintext or plaintext-derived data **in
  clear** on disk: FTS never exists for them; embeddings, PQ code rows/pages
  and codebooks, and ColBERT token matrices are AEAD-sealed under distinct
  AAD domains (search uses decrypt-once RAM caches; the opt-in PQ page tier
  decrypts lazily per probed list). Tests assert the at-rest bytes; new
  derived artifacts must follow the same pattern. **`meta_json` is stored
  UNSEALED**, so nothing that copies words out of the content may live in it
  — `Drawer::meta_at_rest()` empties `time_mentions[].text` and `entities`
  before a row is written, keeping only resolutions (offsets + ISO dates,
  which are not content). What metadata still leaks is measured and pinned by
  `a_sealed_vault_exposes_metadata_but_never_content`: wing, room,
  source_file, added_by, hall, content_date, resolved dates. That test fails
  in **both** directions, so shrinking the exposure forces the inventory to
  be updated. Closing the rest = keyed blind index (truncated HMAC, as
  `fingerprint()` already does) for fields needing SQL equality, sealed blob
  + RAM cache for the rest.
- Cross-lingual retrieval is the **embedder's** job and the default cannot do
  it: `HashEmbedder` is feature hashing over surface forms (word unigrams +
  bigrams + char trigrams, SHA-256 into 384 buckets), so texts match only on
  shared literal tokens/trigrams — measured, an EN/AR translation pair scores
  *below* an unrelated sentence, and `car`/`automobile` do not match either.
  Needs a multilingual model via `onnx`/`ort`, or an external vault. Reading
  dates *inside* the text is the **scanner's** job (`language` per request)
  and is independent of which embedder found the drawer.
- Every write must update the audit chain **atomically with its data**: the
  committed head lives in `chain_meta` and advances via `chain_append` inside
  the same SQLite transaction (the manifest holds a lagging rollback anchor,
  reconciled at open — crash ⇒ fast-forward, rollback ⇒ tamper). Every read
  must verify the record HMAC before returning data.
- Durability is pinned, not assumed: SQLite runs WAL + `synchronous=FULL`
  on both binaries, the manifest anchor is fsynced through an atomic
  rename (+ dir sync), and key material is fsynced at creation. The
  anchor must never run **ahead** of the database — that combination is
  what makes a power loss reconcile as a crash instead of a tamper alarm.
- **A signal is read; a convention is declared; nothing is inferred.** The
  never-guess contract forbids INFERENCE, not EVIDENCE — a distinction that cost
  five attempts to get right. Reading an era marker the writer typed, or a
  field order an unambiguous date in the same drawer demonstrates, or a
  convention the caller declared on `Locale`, are all legitimate. Deriving a
  calendar from surrounding script, or an era from a numeral system, or a field
  order from a numeric range, are not. Where no signal exists the honest answers
  are a documented default (day-first) or a recorded-but-unresolved mention —
  never a confident value, and never silence.
- **A recall measurement cannot justify a precision decision.** The
  promiscuity instrument (how many words of a real 50k vocabulary one query
  links to) counts reach and is blind to correctness; used to justify lowering
  the delimiting floor 8→5 it admitted `other`/`mother` and
  `count`/`accounting`. Any rule feeding a channel that ADMITS needs negative
  controls, not just a link count.
- Cross-vault access must fail cryptographically (AAD binds vault id), not
  just logically.
- Vault/wing/room names go through `undercroft_core::validate_name` (path
  traversal guard).

## Conventions

- Rust 2021, workspace-level dependency versions, `thiserror` per-crate error
  enums, `anyhow` only in the CLI.
- Keys live in `SecretKey` (zeroize-on-drop); never `Debug`-print key material.
- Git identity for this repo: compufreq <compufreq@proton.me>.
- License: **BUSL-1.1** (source-available; rolling 4-year conversion to
  MPL 2.0; `NOTICE` carries the MemPalace MIT heritage attribution).
  Never reintroduce MIT as the project license or publish under it.
- Release flow: full Docker battery (always `--build`) → PR → CI green →
  explicit maintainer approval → merge → tag `vX.Y.Z` → `gh release
  create` (the tag also fires release.yml: binaries + GHCR image) →
  post-merge CI green → Pages live-verified. Version bumps touch
  workspace `Cargo.toml` + `Cargo.lock` (via a Docker `cargo update
  --workspace` — battery images COPY source and never update the host
  lock), `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, CHANGELOG, ROADMAP, and the
  landing hero release button.
