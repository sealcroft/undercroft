# Security model

## Goals

Protect memories **at rest** against disk theft, cross-vault bleed, and
offline tampering of the database or manifest. Detect (not just resist)
modification: every read verifies, `verify` audits everything.

## Mechanisms

- **Master key**: 32-byte key file (0600) or Argon2id(passphrase, salt),
  64 MiB / t=3. Keys zeroized on drop; never logged.
- **Per-vault keys**: HKDF-SHA256(master, vault_salt, "undercroft.v1/vault/<id>/<label>")
  for enc / mac / manifest labels. Vaults never share working keys.
- **Sealing**: XChaCha20-Poly1305, random 24-byte nonce, AAD binds
  `vault_id + record_id` — ciphertext cannot be replayed across vaults or
  record slots. Sealed vaults encrypt content *and* embeddings; nothing
  content-derived is written to disk in plaintext (no FTS index either).
- **Integrity**: HMAC-SHA256 per record (independent key) over
  id + metadata + at-rest content; append-only audit table; chain head
  `h_i = HMAC(mac, h_{i-1} || tag_i)` stored in a MAC'd manifest. Deletions
  log keyed tombstones. KG triples and tunnels carry tags too.
- **Duplicate detection** uses keyed fingerprints (truncated HMAC), so
  stored fingerprints reveal nothing offline.
- **Remote indexes** receive sealed bytes + plaintext embeddings only;
  results are re-verified locally. See the trade-off note in the README.
- **HTTP server**: refuses non-loopback binds without a bearer token;
  `--read-only` strips all mutating tools.

## Non-goals

An attacker reading process memory while a vault is unlocked; a compromised
host OS; traffic analysis of remote-index queries; embedding-inversion
resistance for vectors pushed to remote indexes (documented, opt-in).

## Levels

`sealed` (default): everything above. `hmac-only`: plaintext content with
full integrity tagging + chain — for vaults where grep-ability outweighs
confidentiality.
