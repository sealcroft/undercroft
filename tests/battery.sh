# The full Docker battery, at the tree as it stands, with RAW EXIT CODES.
#
# CLAUDE.md's definition of done asks for exactly this and nothing had ever
# provided it, so every session assembled the battery by hand and paid for it
# twice on 2026-08-06:
#
#   * a summary was built by piping `cargo test` through `awk` and reading a
#     field that did not exist, so it reported `failed=0` from an EMPTY
#     string — a false green derived from output SHAPE rather than from the
#     exit code that was sitting right there;
#   * `lint` was run locally BEFORE the last edit and then reported as green,
#     while the battery failed on a `needless_borrow` introduced after it.
#
# Both are the same defect: a verdict taken from something other than the
# thing that decides it. So this script never parses suite output to decide
# pass/fail — the exit code is the verdict, full stop — and it runs every
# suite in one pass over one tree, which is what makes "I ran it before the
# last edit" impossible rather than merely discouraged.
#
# Usage, from the repo root:
#     bash tests/battery.sh              # everything
#     bash tests/battery.sh test lint    # a subset, same reporting
#
# Exit code: 0 only if every suite selected exited 0.

# Order matters: the cheap suites that fail fastest come first, so a broken
# tree is reported in a minute instead of forty.

# ── preflight: line endings over the WHOLE tree ─────────────────────────────
# `.gitattributes` declares `* text=auto eol=lf` and says why: a CRLF shell
# script breaks in the containers. Nothing enforced it until 2026-08-06, when
# scripted edits written in text mode on Windows converted eleven files and
# `tests/e2e.sh` died with `$'\r': command not found` before a check ran.
#
# The companion gate `no_source_file_has_crlf_line_endings` owns `crates/`,
# because that subtree is complete inside every image. This owns everything
# else — `tests/`, `docs/`, `website/`, the compose files — which NO image
# carries: the test image COPYs only `crates/`, and each e2e service
# bind-mounts its single script. Host-side is the only place the whole tree
# exists, so this runs before any suite rather than inside one.
echo "═══ preflight: line endings ═══"
# `git ls-files --eol` — git owns this concept, so ask git. It prints the
# index ending, the WORKING-TREE ending and the attribute that governs the
# file: `i/lf  w/crlf  attr/text=auto eol=lf`. A `w/crlf` against an `eol=lf`
# attribute is precisely the violation, with no byte-level detection to get
# wrong, no extension allowlist to keep in step, and no dependency on Python.
#
# Two hand-rolled attempts preceded this and each was broken in a DIFFERENT
# direction, which is why both are exercised below rather than assumed:
#   * `grep -qU $'\r'` inside a `while read` subshell — the `$'\r'` never
#     expanded, so the pattern was empty, `grep -q ''` matched every file and
#     the check declared the whole repo corrupt (false POSITIVE);
#   * `awk 'index($0, cr)'` — awk on Windows treats CRLF as the line
#     terminator and strips the CR before `$0` is seen, so a fully-CRLF file
#     read as clean (false NEGATIVE).
# A check whose output does not measure what it claims is the same defect
# whichever way it points.
# The attribute is field 4, not 3 (`i/lf  w/crlf  attr/text=auto  eol=lf`) —
# matching on `$3` was this check's third bug and read every file as clean.
# Hence `$0`, and hence the two-direction test that finally caught it.
