# Changelog

## 0.3.0 — Remote backends + pluggable embedders

- Remote vector indexes (Qdrant, Chroma, pgvector) as untrusted search
  accelerators: sealed content uploaded, candidates HMAC-verified and
  re-ranked locally; `index push/status`, `search --backend`.
- Pluggable embedders with per-vault identity tracking; ONNX
  sentence-embedder crate (tract, feature-gated).
- Compose services + backends-e2e suite against real servers.


## 0.2.0 — Python removal + feature parity port

- Removed the legacy Python implementation and all Python tooling; the Rust
  workspace is now the only implementation.
- Ported: knowledge graph (temporal triples with validity windows),
  conversation mining (Claude Code / Codex JSONL transcripts) + sweep,
  drawer management, agent diaries, hallways/tunnels navigation, dedup,
  stats, backups, repair, hooks output, expanded MCP tool surface.

## 0.1.0 — Rust conversion + vault layer

- Rust workspace: undercroft-core / undercroft-vault / undercroft-store /
  undercroft-cli (fork of MemPalace, Python).
- New hardened memory-management layer: isolated vaults, per-vault HKDF key
  derivation, XChaCha20-Poly1305 sealed content, HMAC-SHA256 integrity tags,
  tamper-evident audit chain, sealed / hmac-only levels.
- Docker-first build + test harness (unit, integration, e2e UI/UX suites).
